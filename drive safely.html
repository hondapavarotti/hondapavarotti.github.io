    <p>Dear boy sitting in the passenger seat of the Toyota RAV4,</p>
<br>
 <p>I’m sorry for snooping on your conversation,</p>
 <p>But as you know, there was an accident on 60 west</p>
 <p>And as we crawled through the Badlands towards Moreno Valley</p>
 <p>I couldn’t help but watch you and your dad talk in my rearview mirror.</p>
<br>
 <p>It looked like you two were returning from a weekend trip</p>
 <p>(Perhaps from camping at Joshua tree or vacationing in Palm Springs)</p>
 <p>And I hope that despite the traffic,</p>
 <p>You enjoyed your car ride back.</p>
<br>
 <p>before you know it,</p>
 <p>you will no longer be able to lean against the window glass,</p>
 <p>And nap as the setting sun warms your face.</p>
<br>
 <p>After a long day of an even longer month </p>
 <p>you’ll have to drive yourself,</p>
 <p>blasting the car radio</p>
 <p>so to not fall asleep on the way home.</p>
<br>
 <p>Hold on to that wonder I see in your eyes, </p>
 <p>watching the dancing shadows </p>
 <p>as the road weaves and dips through the dusty hills.</p>
<br>
 <p>I don’t pretend to have the answers for the problems you will face</p>
 <p>but that wonder will get you far, give you just enough </p>
 <p>to get through the day, when you wake up </p>
 <p>to a world that no longer seems to have a place for you</p>
<br>
 <p>And when the day comes that not even </p>
 <p>the powdery pinks and blues which coat </p>
 <p>the San Bernardino mountains at nightfall</p>
 <p>can bring you joy,</p>
<br>
 <p>remember from dad</p>
 <p>all the wisdom you received while pretending not to care</p>
 <p>all the love that bathed you without ever being words</p>
 <p>all the ways he equipped you for the precarious path ahead.</p>
<br>
 <p>remember also,</p>
 <p>how dad taught you to drive with purpose and diligence </p>
 <p>looking mostly towards the open highway</p>
 <p>but checking your side and rearview mirrors often,</p>
<br>
 <p>for you do not know about those around you</p>
 <p>how long they have been driving</p>
 <p>Or how far left they have to drive </p>
 <p>in order to get home.</p>
<br>
 <p>the fight in you is the heart in you,</p>
 <p>and older boy</p>
